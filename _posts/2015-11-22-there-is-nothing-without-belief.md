### There is nothing without belief

It wasn't very long ago that I was trapped by my previous choices in a very unhappy 'place'. I just turned 38 years old. My hip, which was surgically secured (fused) in place after a high-school auto accident was causing my knee to become more and more damaged. I was fast approaching 296 lbs and getting around was getting harder and harder. I didn't know what I was going to do...An operation to repair my knee was just around the corner if I couldn't reverse my course. My four young children were watching me be unhealthy because I used the excuse of my hip.  My wife didn't nag me, but her fears grew just as my pants size did. She wondered, "Will Joe be at risk for more problems like heart disease, diabetes and stroke...all are in his family history." ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2cea4ea2-bd43-4695-92ef-388f0f04d8d5.jpg)

**I didn't believe I could change.**

This all started to change for the better the day I met Kam Parker, owner and head-trainer at [The Fire Personal Training Studio][0]. Attending one of the [Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce][1]'s opportunities to connect with other business owners, I heard Kam give a presentation about her business. I was struck by her confidence and knowledge. It was if she was talking directly to me! After catching up with her after the event, we talked about my situation. She agreed to take me on as a one-on-one personal training client. Her only requirement was that my level of commitment to see this journey through was going to have to be extremely high (not wasting her/my time). You can trust she pushed me hard enough that I wanted to give up, plenty. But that's not the reason I've successfully changed my health and fitness levels. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c0af733a-70c1-49c4-bc66-bb68de9cab57.jpg)

**It's because I finally believed I could do it, then I didn't stop.**Once I started to push through and start forming better habits, my belief started to soar. Training and diet changes got me to a new level, but understanding of the emotional changes I needed to conquer was the tipping point that **has helped me create lasting change. **Now I like to share my story with anyone who wants to listen.

Until I believed it was possible, I was stuck. Not anymore. If you need help getting on your way to a more fit and health version of yourself, [contact me.][2]
